## Workspace Resolution

1. If `$ARGUMENTS` specifies a project name, use `workspaces/$ARGUMENTS/`
2. Otherwise, use the most recently modified directory under `workspaces/` (excluding `instructions/`)
3. If no workspace exists, ask the user to create one first
4. Read all files in `workspaces/<project>/briefs/` for user context (this is the user's input surface)

## Phase Check

- Read `workspaces/<project>/04-validate/` to confirm validation passed
- Read `docs/` and `docs/00-authority/` for knowledge base
- Output: update existing agents and skills in their canonical locations (e.g., `agents/frameworks/`, `skills/01-core-sdk/`, `skills/02-dataflow/`, etc.)

## BUILD vs USE Repo Distinction (where does /codify write?)

`/codify` writes to different locations depending on which repo it runs in. Before extracting knowledge, determine the repo type and follow the correct placement rule:

- **BUILD repos** (kailash-py, kailash-rs, kailash-prism — source of truth for the SDKs): write to **canonical locations** (`agents/frameworks/`, `agents/analysis/`, `skills/01-core-sdk/`, `skills/02-dataflow/`, `rules/*.md`, etc.) AND append an entry to `.claude/.proposals/latest.yaml` so loom/ can pick the change up via Gate 1. BUILD repos MUST NOT write to `agents/project/` or `skills/project/` — those directories are a downstream-USE-only convention and should not exist in a BUILD repo.
- **loom/** (COC authority): write to canonical locations and variant overlays (`.claude/agents/...`, `.claude/variants/{lang}/...`). loom/ has no `project/` subdirectories. Propose CC/CO-tier artifacts upstream to atelier/ as described in Step 7.
- **Downstream USE repos** (consumer projects that `pip install kailash`, `gem install kailash`, etc.): write project-specific artifacts to `.claude/agents/project/<name>.md` and `.claude/skills/project/<name>/SKILL.md`. These stay **LOCAL** — no proposal file is created, no upstream flow. The `project/` directories are the preservation boundary on `/sync` (shared artifacts are overwritten by the template; `project/` is preserved).

See `rules/artifact-flow.md` for the authority chain and `guides/co-setup/03-creating-components.md` for component placement.

## Execution Model

This phase executes under the **autonomous execution model** (see `rules/autonomous-execution.md`). Knowledge extraction and codification are autonomous — agents extract, structure, and validate knowledge without human intervention. The human reviews the codified output at the end (structural gate on what becomes institutional knowledge), but the extraction and synthesis process is fully autonomous.

## Workflow

### 1. Consume learning digest

Before extracting new knowledge, integrate what the learning system has captured:

1. Read `.claude/learning/learning-digest.json` — the structured summary of recent observations
2. Read `.claude/learning/learning-codified.json` — what was previously codified (avoid re-processing)
3. Read recent journal entries referenced in the digest (`decisions` array) — DECISION and DISCOVERY entries contain semantic context
4. Read `.session-notes` — latest session accomplishments and outstanding items

Analyze the digest for actionable findings:

- **Corrections** → Do any rules or skills need updating to match user preferences? Each correction is a real signal where the user pushed back on an approach.
- **Error patterns** → Should any recurring rule violations become new rule sections (DO/DO NOT with examples)?
- **Decisions** → Should any architectural decisions from journals become agent or skill knowledge?
- **Accomplishments** → Do any completed features need documentation in skills?

For each finding, either:

- Update an existing rule (add DO/DO NOT with example and Why)
- Update a skill's SKILL.md or sub-files
- Update an agent's knowledge section
- Skip (not worth codifying — explain why)

After processing, write `.claude/learning/learning-codified.json` to record what was analyzed:

```json
{
  "last_codified": "2026-04-07T12:00:00Z",
  "digest_hash": "<sha256 of digest at time of processing>",
  "actions_taken": [
    { "type": "rule_update", "file": "rules/patterns.md", "reason": "..." },
    {
      "type": "skill_update",
      "file": "skills/03-nexus/SKILL.md",
      "reason": "..."
    }
  ]
}
```

This closes the feedback loop: observe → digest → **codify into real artifacts**.

### 2. Deep knowledge extraction

Using as many subagents as required, peruse `docs/`, especially `docs/00-authority/`, and `specs/` for domain specifications.

- Read beyond the docs into the intent of this project/product
- Read `specs/` to understand the detailed domain truth — specs contain the nuanced decisions, contracts, and constraints that should inform agent and skill updates
- Understand the roles and use of agents, skills, docs:
  - **Agents** — What to do, how to think about this, following procedural directives
  - **Skills** — Distilled knowledge for 100% situational awareness
  - **`docs/`** — Full knowledge base
  - **`specs/`** — Detailed domain specifications (authority on what the system does)

### 3. Update existing agents

Improve agents in their canonical locations.

- Reference `.claude/agents/_subagent-guide.md` for agent format
- Identify which existing agent(s) should absorb the new knowledge
- If no existing agent covers the domain, create a new agent in the appropriate directory

### 4. Update existing skills

Improve skills in their canonical locations.

- Reference `.claude/guides/claude-code/06-the-skill-system.md` for skill format
- Update the directory's `SKILL.md` entry point to reference new files
- Skills must be detailed enough for agents to achieve situational awareness from them alone

### 5. Update README.md and documentation (MANDATORY)

Ensure user-facing documentation reflects new capabilities. Verify README.md, docstrings, and docs build.

### 6. Red team the agents and skills

Validate that generated agents and skills are correct, complete, and secure. **claude-code-architect** verifies cc-artifacts compliance (descriptions under 120 chars, agents under 400 lines, commands under 150 lines, rules path-scoped, SKILL.md progressive disclosure).

### 7. Create upstream proposal (BUILD repos) / 8. Upstream to atelier (loom only)

Follow the proposal protocol in `guides/co-setup/09-proposal-protocol.md`. Key rules:

- **BUILD repos** (kailash-py, kailash-rs): Create/append proposal at `.claude/.proposals/latest.yaml` for loom/ review. **Append, never overwrite** unprocessed proposals. See `rules/artifact-flow.md`.
- **loom/**: Propose CC/CO-tier artifacts upstream to atelier/ using the same append-not-overwrite protocol.
- **Downstream project repos**: SKIP. Changes stay local.

### 9. Release drift check (BUILD repos only)

After codify, check `[RELEASE-DRIFT]` output from session-start OR run `node -e "const d=require('./scripts/hooks/lib/release-drift');console.log(d.detectUnreleasedPackages(process.cwd()))"`. If any packages have commits since their last release tag, recommend the user run `/release` before ending the session — codify commits add to the unreleased backlog and silent drift accumulates across sessions. Silent on downstream repos / non-package repos.

## Agent Teams

Deploy these agents as a team for codification:

**Knowledge extraction team:**

- **analyst** — Identify core patterns, architectural decisions, and domain knowledge worth capturing
- **analyst** — Distill requirements into reusable agent instructions
- `co-reference` skill — Ensure agents and skills follow COC five-layer architecture (codification IS Layer 5 evolution)

**Creation team:**

- **reviewer** — Validate that skill examples are correct and runnable
- **reviewer** — Review agent/skill quality before finalizing

**Validation team (red team the agents and skills):**

- **claude-code-architect** — Verify cc-artifacts compliance: descriptions <120 chars, agents <400 lines, commands <150 lines, rules have `paths:` frontmatter, SKILL.md progressive disclosure, no CLAUDE.md duplication
- **gold-standards-validator** — Terrene naming, licensing accuracy, terminology standards
- **testing-specialist** — Verify any code examples in skills are testable
- **security-reviewer** — Audit agents/skills for prompt injection, insecure patterns, secrets exposure

### Journal (MUST — phase-complete gate)

Before reporting `/codify` complete, create `/journal new <TYPE> <slug>` entries for: **DECISION** (which rules/skills/agents were updated and why), **DISCOVERY** (patterns extracted into institutional knowledge that the next session should inherit). Skip only if nothing is journal-worthy; do not batch.
