Sync CO/COC artifacts. Behavior depends on repo type (from `.claude/VERSION`).

**Usage**: `/sync [target]`

- At loom/ (coc-source): `target` = `py`, `rs`, or `all`. If omitted, ask.
- At downstream projects (coc-project): no target needed.

## Step 0: Detect Repo Type

Read `.claude/VERSION` → `type` field:

- `coc-source` → Gate 1 + Gate 2 (below)
- `coc-project` → Downstream Sync (next section)
- `coc-use-template` / `coc-build` → **MUST verify** the repo is the actual template/BUILD repo before routing to loom. Check `basename $(pwd)` + `git remote get-url origin` (normalize SSH `git@host:owner/repo.git` → `owner/repo`) against known repos: `kailash-coc-claude-{py,rs,rb,prism}`, `kailash-{py,rs,prism}`. If match → "receives artifacts from loom/, run `/sync` at loom/". If no match → treat as `coc-project` and auto-correct VERSION in-place (type → `coc-project`, upstream → `{template, template_repo, template_version, synced_at, sdk_packages}` per `scripts/hooks/lib/version-utils.js::correctTemplateDerivedVersion`), then Downstream Sync.
- Missing → ask user what type this repo is

## Downstream Sync (coc-project repos)

Pull latest artifacts from the USE template repo. No target needed — reads template identity from VERSION.

**Process**:

1. **Resolve template**: If `scripts/resolve-template.js` exists, run `node scripts/resolve-template.js`. Otherwise resolve manually:
   - Read `upstream.template` and `upstream.template_repo` from `.claude/VERSION`
   - Check local sibling: `../<template>/` or `~/repos/loom/<template>/`
   - Check cache: `~/.cache/kailash-coc/<template>/`
   - If not found: `git clone --depth 1 --single-branch --branch main https://github.com/<template_repo>.git ~/.cache/kailash-coc/<template>/`
   - Known slugs: `kailash-coc-claude-py` → `terrene-foundation/kailash-coc-claude-py`, same for `-rs`, `-rb`, `-prism`
2. **Diff** template's `.claude/` + `scripts/` against local
3. **Additive merge** (same semantics as Gate 2 step 4):
   - Template files overwrite matching local files
   - Local-only files preserved (never deleted)
   - **NEVER overwritten** (downstream-owned): `CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/VERSION`, `.claude/settings.local.json`, `.env`, `.git/`, `.claude/.proposals/`, `.claude/learning/`
   - Other exclusions: see sync-flow guide § "What downstream NEVER gets"
4. **Present merge plan** with per-file decisions before applying
5. **Verify** hook paths in `settings.json` resolve on disk
6. **Update `.claude/VERSION` in-place** (never replace the file — only update specific fields): `upstream.template_version` ← template VERSION's `version`, `upstream.template_repo` ← resolved GitHub slug, `upstream.synced_at` ← now, `upstream.sdk_packages` ← from template. MUST preserve `type: coc-project`, `upstream.template` (name), and all other fields.
7. **Update SDK pins** in `pyproject.toml`/`Cargo.toml` from template VERSION's `upstream.sdk_packages`
8. **Install**: `uv sync` (py) or `cargo check` (rs) — **MANDATORY**
9. **Update `.claude/.coc-sync-marker`** with timestamp

## Two Gates (coc-source — loom/ only)

This command has two sequential gates. Gate 1 runs automatically if unreviewed changes exist.

### Gate 1: Review (inbound — BUILD repo → loom/)

Scans the BUILD repo for artifact changes not yet upstreamed to loom/.

**Trigger**: Runs automatically when `/sync` detects unreviewed changes. Also runs if the user explicitly says "review" (e.g., `/sync py review`).

**Process**:

1. Read `sync-manifest.yaml` for tier membership and variant mappings
2. Read BUILD repo path from `sync-manifest.yaml` → `repos.{target}.build`
3. **Read SDK version** from BUILD repo's `pyproject.toml` (py) or `Cargo.toml` (rs). Report it in the review header so the reviewer knows which SDK release these artifacts come from.
4. Compute **expected state**: for each file in loom/.claude/, apply the correct variant overlay for this target. This is what the BUILD repo SHOULD have if it were freshly synced.
5. Diff BUILD repo's `.claude/` against expected state
6. Also check for `.claude/.proposals/latest.yaml` (created by /codify):
   - If `status: pending_review` — new unprocessed proposal. Proceed with review.
   - If `status: reviewed` — already classified in a prior `/sync`, but check whether new changes were appended after the review (look for entries below the `reviewed_date`). If new entries exist, re-review only those.
   - If `status: distributed` — fully processed. Skip proposal review unless BUILD repo diffs show changes outside the proposal.
   - If the proposal includes `sdk_version`, verify it matches the current BUILD repo SDK version — a mismatch means the proposal is stale (codified against an older release).
   - Multi-session proposals may contain changes from several `/codify` sessions (separated by date-stamped comment blocks). Review ALL unreviewed changes, not just the latest session.
7. For each NEW or MODIFIED file, classify:
   - Deploy **sync-reviewer** agent team for autonomous classification (global vs variant vs skip)
   - Agent team reads both source and BUILD versions, checks for language-specific content
   - Present consolidated classification with reasoning for approval

8. For each change classified as **global**, consider cross-SDK impact:
   - Does rs need an equivalent adaptation? If yes → create alignment note.

9. Place files:
   - **Global** → copy to `loom/.claude/{type}/{file}`
   - **Variant** → copy to `loom/.claude/variants/{lang}/{type}/{file}`
   - **Skip** → leave in BUILD repo only

10. Mark proposal as reviewed (update `.proposals/latest.yaml` status)

**Skip conditions**: Gate 1 is skipped when:

- No changes detected between BUILD repo and expected state
- User explicitly says "distribute only" or "skip review"

### Gate 2: Distribute (outbound — loom/ → templates)

Merges loom/ source + variant overlays into USE template repos. This is a **merge** — templates may have legitimate local content.

**Process**:

1. **Read manifest** (`sync-manifest.yaml`) for tiers, variants, exclusions
2. **Inventory the template** — read what's currently there before computing changes
3. **Compute expected state** for the target (py or rs):
   - Global files from `.claude/` (agents/, commands/, rules/, skills/, guides/)
   - Variant overlay from `variants/{lang}/` — replacements and additions
   - Scripts/ with same overlay logic
4. **Per-file merge decisions**:
   - **UNCHANGED** → skip
   - **NEW** (in source, not in template) → add
   - **MODIFIED** (both exist, content differs) → read both versions. If template has USE-specific adaptations (e.g., different wording for downstream context), flag for review before overwriting
   - **TEMPLATE-ONLY** (in template, not in source) → preserve (never delete)
5. **Present merge plan** with per-file decisions, not a bulk "Apply all"
6. **Apply approved changes**
7. **Update `.coc-sync-marker`** with timestamp and file list
8. **Update `.claude/VERSION`** — set `upstream.build_version` to loom/'s version. Create VERSION if missing (per `guides/co-setup/08-versioning.md`). **MUST update `upstream.sdk_packages`** with all package versions from the BUILD repo (read from `pyproject.toml`/`Cargo.toml`). This map is what session-start hooks use to detect stale pins in downstream repos.
9. **Update SDK dependency pins** in the target's `pyproject.toml` (py) or `Cargo.toml` (rs) — **MANDATORY, never skip**:
   - **py**: Read version from BUILD repo's root `pyproject.toml` and each `packages/*/pyproject.toml`. Update the target's `pyproject.toml` `dependencies` section so each Kailash package pin (`>=X.Y.Z`) matches the BUILD repo's current release version. This applies to ALL targets — templates AND downstream repos.
   - **rs**: Read version from BUILD repo's root `Cargo.toml` and workspace member `Cargo.toml` files. Update the target's `Cargo.toml` dependency versions accordingly.
   - Report any version changes in the sync report.
10. **Install updated dependencies** — **MANDATORY, never skip**:
    - **py**: Run `uv sync` in the target repo. If `.venv` doesn't exist, run `uv venv && uv sync`. MUST NOT use `pip install`, `pip install -e .`, or any non-`uv` installer.
    - **rs**: Run `cargo check` in the target repo to verify dependency resolution.
    - Report success/failure in the sync report.
11. **Verify hooks** — every hook in `settings.json` has a corresponding script on disk
12. **Mark proposal as distributed** — after Gate 2 completes successfully, update the BUILD repo's `.claude/.proposals/latest.yaml`:
    - Set `status: distributed`
    - Add `distributed_date: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`
    - This signals to the next `/codify` run that it is safe to create a fresh proposal (or archive and replace). Without this step, `/codify` would see `reviewed` and append rather than start fresh, accumulating stale entries indefinitely.

**Report**:

```
## Sync Report: loom/ → kailash-coc-claude-py/
Gate 1: 3 reviewed (1 global, 1 variant-py, 1 skipped), SDK 2.2.1
Gate 2: 12 updated, 2 added, 1 flagged, 482 unchanged, 3 preserved
SDK pins: kailash 2.2.1→2.3.0, kailash-dataflow 1.2.1→1.3.0
Dependencies: uv sync ✓ | Hooks: 11/11 | VERSION: 1.0.0→1.1.0
```

## Exclusions

Never synced: `learning/`, `.proposals/`, `sync-manifest.yaml`, `variants/`, `settings.local.json`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.env`, `.git/`. See sync-flow guide § "What downstream NEVER gets" for full list.

## Delegate

**Gate 1**: Delegate to **sync-reviewer** agent. **Gate 2**: Delegate to **coc-sync** agent — MUST read target content before writing, no bulk overwrites. **Downstream**: No delegation needed — agent handles directly.

## Examples

- `/sync py` — loom/: review kailash-py changes, merge to coc-claude-py
- `/sync` — downstream project: pull latest from USE template
