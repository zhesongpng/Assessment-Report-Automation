# Dependency Rules

## Latest Versions Always

All dependencies MUST use the latest stable version. Do not pin to old versions out of caution.

**Why:** Defensive pinning creates a maintenance treadmill where every update requires manual cap-bumping, and the project silently falls behind on security patches, performance improvements, and API fixes.

```toml
# ✅ Uncapped or wide range
pydantic = ">=2.0"
polars = ">=1.0"

# ❌ Defensive caps
pydantic = ">=2.0,<3.0"
polars = ">=1.0,<1.5"
```

## No Caps on Transitive Dependencies

Do NOT add version constraints for packages your code does not directly import. If a package is only a transitive dependency (required by one of your direct dependencies), let the upstream package manage compatibility.

**Why:** Capping a transitive dependency you don't import is purely speculative — you have no code that could break. The upstream package already declares its own compatibility range. Your cap just blocks users from getting updates and creates resolution conflicts.

```toml
# ❌ datasets is used by trl and transformers, not by us
dependencies = ["trl>=0.12", "datasets>=3.0,<4.0"]

# ✅ Only constrain what you import
dependencies = ["trl>=0.12"]
```

**Test:** `grep -r "import datasets" src/` returns zero? Then `datasets` is not your dependency — remove it from `pyproject.toml`.

## Own the Stack — Replace or Re-Implement

If a dependency is unmaintained (no release in 12+ months, unresolved critical issues, archived repo) or constrains your architecture, re-implement it with full API parity. Do not work around a broken or stale package — own the code.

This applies equally to small utilities and large frameworks. If the reference package does X, your replacement MUST do X with identical behavior at the API surface.

**Why:** Unmaintained packages accumulate CVEs, break with new Python/Rust versions, and force the entire ecosystem to work around their bugs. Owning the implementation eliminates the external risk and gives you full control over the API surface, performance, and release cadence.

Process:

1. Identify the full API surface of the reference package that you (or your users) depend on
2. Re-implement with full parity — every public function, class, and behavior
3. Test against the reference package's own test suite where available
4. Provide a drop-in migration path (same import names or thin adapter)
5. Remove the old dependency

## Minimum Version Floors Are Fine

Lower bounds (`>=X.Y`) are appropriate when your code uses features introduced in that version.

**Why:** A floor prevents users from hitting cryptic errors when they install an old version missing the API you call.

```toml
# ✅ We use pydantic v2 model_validator
pydantic = ">=2.0"

# ✅ We use polars LazyFrame.collect_async (added in 0.20)
polars = ">=0.20"
```

## MUST NOT

- Cap a dependency you do not directly import

**Why:** You cannot know when a transitive dependency will break your code because you have no code that uses it. The cap just blocks upgrades.

- Pin exact versions in library pyproject.toml (`==X.Y.Z`)

**Why:** Exact pins in libraries create resolution conflicts for every downstream user who has a different pin.

- Keep unmaintained dependencies — re-implement instead

**Why:** Every unmaintained dependency is a ticking time bomb that will eventually block a Python/Rust version upgrade or introduce a security vulnerability. If you can build it, own it.

- Work around a broken dependency instead of replacing it

**Why:** Workarounds create parallel implementations that diverge from the reference API, doubling maintenance cost and surprising users with behavior differences.

## Declared = Imported — No Silent Missing Dependencies

Every `import X` / `from X import Y` / `use X` / `require('X')` in production code MUST resolve to a package explicitly listed in the project's dependency manifest (`pyproject.toml`, `Cargo.toml`, `package.json`). Transitive resolution through another package is NOT a declaration.

### MUST: Add manifest entry in the same commit as the import

When you add an import, you add the dependency in the same commit. There is no "I'll add it to requirements later".

```python
# DO — import + manifest entry in the same commit
# pyproject.toml: dependencies = [..., "redis>=5.0"]
import redis

# DO NOT — import exists, manifest entry does not
import redis  # works locally because something else installed it; breaks in fresh venv
```

**Why:** Missing manifest entries are invisible on the developer's machine (where the package was installed transitively or manually) and only fail on fresh installs, CI, or production deploy. Every "works locally, breaks in CI" incident traces back to this.

### MUST: Treat dependency resolution errors as blocking failures

The following errors are the SAME class as pre-existing failures in `zero-tolerance.md` Rule 1 — they MUST be fixed immediately, not suppressed:

- `ModuleNotFoundError` / `ImportError` (Python)
- `cannot find crate` / `unresolved import` (Rust)
- `Cannot find module` / `Module not found` (JS/TS)
- Peer dependency warnings during `npm install` / `yarn install`
- `pip check` failures reporting unmet or conflicting requirements

### BLOCKED Anti-Patterns

```python
# Python — BLOCKED: dodging declaration with a silent fallback
try:
    import redis
except ImportError:
    redis = None  # silently degrades; production path never works

# Python — BLOCKED: hiding a missing module from the type checker
import redis  # type: ignore[import]
```

```typescript
// TypeScript — BLOCKED: suppressing module resolution
// @ts-ignore
import { something } from "missing-package";
```

**Why:** Each of these patterns converts a loud, fixable failure ("package not declared") into a silent, cascading one ("feature doesn't work and nobody knows why"). The `try/except ImportError` pattern is particularly dangerous because it makes the import "succeed" with `None`, pushing the failure to a runtime `AttributeError` deep in a code path that only runs in production.

### Exception: Optional Extras with Loud Failure

`try/except ImportError` IS allowed for packages declared as optional extras (`[project.optional-dependencies]`) IF the fallback raises a descriptive error at the call site naming the missing extra. Silent degradation to `None` is still BLOCKED.

```python
# DO — optional extra with loud, actionable failure
try:
    import redis
except ImportError:
    redis = None

def get_cache_client():
    if redis is None:
        raise ImportError("redis backend requires the [redis] extra: pip install kailash[redis]")
    return redis.Redis(...)

# DO NOT — silent None propagation
try:
    import redis
except ImportError:
    redis = None

def get_cache_client():
    return redis.Redis(...) if redis else None  # downstream gets None, fails with AttributeError
```

This exception aligns with `infrastructure-sql.md` Rule 8 (lazy driver imports). The principle: optional dependencies are fine; silent degradation is not.

## Declared = Gated Consistently — Optional Dependencies + Feature Gates

When a package declares an optional dependency behind a feature (Rust `[features]`, Python `[project.optional-dependencies]`, npm `peerDependencies`, Ruby bundler groups), every module that imports from that optional dep MUST be gated with the SAME feature name, AND every downstream feature that imports symbols FROM that module MUST transitively require the same feature.

The failure mode is invisible under default features (where the feature is always on) and only surfaces when a narrow feature subset is built — `cargo doc --no-default-features`, `pip install pkg` without an extra, `npm install --omit=optional`. By that time the gap is a full matrix rebuild away. The two-point fix (module gate + downstream feature imply) is the only structural defense.

### MUST: Module Gate Matches Optional-Dep Gate

Every module that does `use optional_dep::` (Rust) / `import optional_pkg` at module-scope (Python) MUST be declared with the matching feature / extra gate.

```rust
// DO — Rust: module gate matches dep gate
// Cargo.toml: kaizen-agents = { optional = true }
//             [features] orchestration = ["dep:kaizen-agents"]
#[cfg(feature = "orchestration")]
pub mod kaizen;   // kaizen/*.rs uses `kaizen_agents::`

// DO NOT — Rust: module ungated while its imports require the feature
pub mod kaizen;   // `use kaizen_agents::...` inside fails under --no-default-features
```

```python
# DO — Python: module-scope imports gated at the package-extras boundary
# pyproject.toml: [project.optional-dependencies]
#                 redis = ["redis>=5.0"]
# src/kailash/cache/redis_backend.py — only imported by code-paths that check for the extra
try:
    import redis
except ImportError:
    redis = None

def get_redis_client(url: str):
    if redis is None:
        raise ImportError("redis backend requires the [redis] extra: pip install kailash[redis]")
    return redis.Redis.from_url(url)

# DO NOT — Python: module-scope import of an optional extra at package __init__
# src/kailash/__init__.py
import redis   # ImportError on `pip install kailash` without [redis]; package unimportable
```

**BLOCKED rationalizations:**

- "The default feature is always on in production, so the narrow build never happens"
- "`cargo doc --no-default-features` is a CI concern, not a code concern"
- "The extra is 'required-recommended', everyone installs it"
- "We'll add the gate when someone reports it"

**Why:** The optional-dep contract promises that a narrow build works. A single ungated module voids that contract silently — CI catches it the day someone runs `--no-default-features` and finds 7 unrelated-looking compile errors. Evidence: kailash-rs#417 (2026-04-19) — 3 bindings, 7 compile errors on `--no-default-features`, fixed by gating the modules to match the deps.

### MUST: Downstream Feature Transitively Enables Required Feature

When a downstream feature imports symbols from a module gated by `feature = "X"`, the downstream feature MUST declare `"X"` in its dependency list. Leaving it off makes `--features downstream` unbuildable under `--no-default-features`.

```toml
# DO — Rust: downstream feature enables the transitively-required feature
[features]
orchestration = ["dep:kaizen-agents"]
kailash_kaizen_llm_deployment = ["orchestration", "kailash-kaizen/..."]

# DO NOT — Rust: leaves --features kailash_kaizen_llm_deployment unbuildable
# on --no-default-features
[features]
kailash_kaizen_llm_deployment = ["kailash-kaizen/..."]
```

```toml
# DO — Python: downstream extra implies upstream extras
[project.optional-dependencies]
redis  = ["redis>=5.0"]
cache  = ["kailash[redis]"]            # cache imports from the redis-gated module → depend on [redis]
full   = ["kailash[redis,cache]"]

# DO NOT — Python: downstream extra skips the implied extra
cache  = ["orjson>=3.0"]                # cache imports redis_backend but doesn't require [redis]
```

**Why:** A downstream feature that imports from a gated module but doesn't imply the gate ships a permanently broken feature combination. Consumers who enable only the narrow feature hit the same compile errors the default build hides.

### Audit

Mechanical grep at `/redteam` and `/codify` time:

```bash
# Rust — bindings / crates that `use <optional_dep>::` without a matching #[cfg]
rg 'use (kaizen_agents|kailash_align_serving|kailash_ml)::' crates/ bindings/ -l \
  | xargs grep -L '#\[cfg(feature'

# Python — module-scope imports of declared optional extras
# (top-level import of an optional_extra package in a non-optional module is BLOCKED)
for extra_pkg in redis psycopg2 asyncpg prometheus_client; do
  rg "^import $extra_pkg\b|^from $extra_pkg " src/ packages/ \
    --glob '!**/optional/**' --glob '!**/backends/**' -l
done
```

Any match is a HIGH finding.

Origin: kailash-rs#417 (2026-04-19) — 3 bindings, 7 `--no-default-features` compile errors. Fix commit `d04c098a`. Journal: `workspaces/binding-parity/journal/0038-DISCOVERY-binding-feature-gate-consistency.md`.

## Verification Step (All Dependencies)

Before `/redteam` and `/deploy`, run the project's dependency resolver as a verification step:

```bash
# Python — pip check catches unmet/conflicting requirements
pip check

# Node
npm ls --all 2>&1 | grep -iE "missing|warn|err"

# Rust
cargo check --quiet
```

Any unmet, missing, or conflicting dependency BLOCKS the gate.

## Phantom Transitive Deps — Resolve Via Lockfile Upgrade, Not Local Caps

When `pip check` / `cargo tree -d` / `npm ls` reports a conflict whose root is an unused transitive dependency, the fix MUST be to let the solver drop the orphan (`uv lock --upgrade-package X` + `uv sync`, `cargo update -p X`, `npm update X`). Adding a local cap / pin on a package this project does not directly import is BLOCKED.

```bash
# DO — Python: let uv drop the orphan transitive
uv lock --upgrade-package google-generativeai   # solver re-resolves; orphan drops
uv sync                                         # lockfile + venv converge
pip check                                       # clean

# DO — Rust: cargo update drops the orphan
cargo update -p some-transitive-crate

# DO NOT — pin the orphan in the manifest
# pyproject.toml:
# dependencies = [..., "protobuf>=4.0,<5.0"]  # we don't import protobuf; this is speculative
```

**BLOCKED rationalizations:**

- "The lockfile solver might not find a clean resolution"
- "A local cap is faster than re-resolving the lockfile"
- "We'll remove the cap later"
- "The transitive is 'required-recommended' even though we don't import it"
- "Capping is safer than trusting the upstream compat range"

**Why:** A phantom transitive dep — one installed by the lockfile but zero-imports in the project — that holds a secondary package at an old cap is a solver trap: every upgrade of the actually-imported deps is blocked by the phantom's constraint. Pinning at the manifest level locks the trap in permanently; the only fix that keeps the solver free is `uv lock --upgrade-package` / `cargo update -p` / `npm update` which lets the resolver drop the phantom when it's no longer required by any imported package. Manifest-level caps on unimported packages also silently violate `§ No Caps on Transitive Dependencies` above.

Origin: kailash-py PR #530 (2026-04-19) — `google-generativeai 0.8.6` was installed by the lockfile with zero imports in the project, holding `protobuf` at an old cap that blocked the `kailash-align 0.3.2` release. Fix: `uv lock --upgrade-package google-generativeai` dropped it cleanly, protobuf upgraded, release unblocked.
