# Observability Rules

If a code path is not logged, it does not exist. Post-deployment integration failures are almost always failures to observe what was already broken in dev. Logs are not a debugging convenience — they are the contract that lets the next session know what happened.

## Mandatory Log Points

Every code change MUST emit a structured log line at each of these junctures. No exceptions.

### 1. Endpoints (HTTP, RPC, MCP, CLI commands)

Entry, exit, and error paths each get a log line. Entry captures intent; exit captures outcome and latency; error captures stack and trace ID.

```python
# DO
@router.post("/users")
async def create_user(req: CreateUserRequest):
    logger.info("create_user.start", route="/users", request_id=req.request_id)
    t0 = time.monotonic()
    try:
        user = await db.express.create("User", req.fields())
        logger.info("create_user.ok", user_id=user["id"], latency_ms=(time.monotonic()-t0)*1000)
        return user
    except Exception as e:
        logger.exception("create_user.error", error=str(e), latency_ms=(time.monotonic()-t0)*1000)
        raise

# DO NOT
@router.post("/users")
async def create_user(req: CreateUserRequest):
    return await db.express.create("User", req.fields())  # zero observability
```

**Why:** Without entry+exit+error logs, every production failure becomes a guess about which step failed. The first 30 minutes of any incident are spent recreating what the logs should have already captured.

### 2. Integration Points (outbound HTTP, DB, message queue, file IO, third-party SDKs)

Every cross-boundary call MUST log intent (what + where) and result (status + duration). This applies whether the call is real, mocked, or against a fake backend.

```python
# DO
logger.info("stripe.charge.start", customer_id=cid, amount_cents=amount)
resp = await stripe.charges.create(customer=cid, amount=amount)
logger.info("stripe.charge.ok", charge_id=resp.id, latency_ms=resp.elapsed_ms)

# DO NOT
resp = await stripe.charges.create(customer=cid, amount=amount)  # silent integration
```

**Why:** Outbound calls are where 80% of post-deploy failures live (auth changes, schema drift, network policy). Without logs at the boundary, you can't tell whether your code or the dependency failed.

### 3. Data Calls — Real, Fake, or Simulated

Every data fetch MUST log the source mode in the log line itself. This is non-negotiable. The mode field lets `grep mode=fake` find every place a fake was left in code.

```python
# DO — real
logger.info("user.fetch", user_id=uid, source="postgres", mode="real")

# DO — fake (during dev only; presence in prod logs is itself a violation)
logger.warning("user.fetch", user_id=uid, source="fixture", mode="fake")

# DO NOT
user = await fetch_user(uid)  # is this real? fake? cached? no one knows
```

**Why:** "Mock data shipped to prod" is a recurring incident class. A `mode=fake` field in every data-call log line turns a silent disaster into a single grep.

### 4. State Transitions, Auth Events, Config Loads

INFO level, once per transition. Auth events (login, logout, permission grant/revoke) MUST log subject, action, and outcome. Config loads MUST log which file/env var was used.

```python
# DO
logger.info("auth.login.ok", user_id=uid, method="password")
logger.info("config.loaded", source=".env", keys_loaded=len(loaded))

# DO NOT
# (no log at all — auth state changes invisible to ops)
```

**Why:** Auth failures and config drifts are the second-most-common production incidents and are nearly impossible to diagnose without their own log lines.

## MUST Rules

### 1. Use the Framework Logger — Never `print`

`print()`, `console.log()`, `eprintln!`, `puts` are BLOCKED in production code. MUST use the framework's structured logger (see variant rules for the per-language binding).

**Why:** `print` writes unstructured strings to stdout with no level, no field tagging, and no log routing. It cannot be filtered, aggregated, or shipped to a log aggregator, and it disappears the moment the process restarts.

### 2. Correlation ID on Every Log Line

Every log line in a request/handler/agent execution MUST carry a correlation ID (request_id, trace_id, run_id) bound for the entire scope of that execution. Use the framework's context propagation (contextvars, AsyncLocalStorage, span context).

```python
# DO
logger = structlog.get_logger().bind(request_id=req.headers["x-request-id"])
logger.info("step.1.start")
logger.info("step.2.start")

# DO NOT
logger.info("step.1.start")  # no request_id — cannot reconstruct request flow
```

**Why:** Without correlation IDs, multi-step requests interleave in logs and become impossible to trace. A log without a correlation ID is a sentence without a subject.

### 3. Log Levels Have Distinct Meanings

| Level | When                                                                            |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ERROR | The operation failed and a user/caller will see the failure                     |
| WARN  | The operation succeeded but used a fallback, retry, or degraded path            |
| INFO  | A normal state transition the operator should be able to see in production      |
| DEBUG | Step-by-step detail useful only during a specific investigation; off by default |

**Why:** When everything is INFO (or everything is ERROR), filters become useless and real incidents drown in noise. The level field is the operator's most important triage tool.

### 4. Never Log Secrets, Tokens, or PII

See `rules/security.md` § "No secrets in logs". The same rule applies to structured log fields — redact tokens, never log raw credentials.

### 5. Log Triage Gate — Read Before Reporting Done

Before any of `/implement`, `/redteam`, `/deploy`, `/wrapup` reports complete, MUST scan for WARN+ entries and acknowledge each one.

**Concrete scan commands** (run all that apply to the project):

```bash
# Test runner output (most recent run)
pytest --tb=short 2>&1 | grep -iE 'warn|error|deprecat|fail' | sort -u

# Project log directory (any *.log file modified in the last 2 hours — proxy for "this session")
find . -name "*.log" -mmin -120 -exec grep -HnE 'WARN|ERROR|FAIL' {} +

# Build tool output
npm run build 2>&1 | grep -iE 'warn|error' | sort -u
cargo build 2>&1 | grep -iE 'warning|error'

# Dependency resolver
pip check 2>&1
npm ls --all 2>&1 | grep -iE 'missing|warn|err'
```

**Disposition protocol** (per unique entry, not per occurrence):

1. Group identical WARN+ entries: same source file + same message pattern = one entry. Count occurrences but state disposition once.
2. For each unique entry, state one of:
   - **Fixed** — root cause addressed in this session, with the commit SHA
   - **Deferred** — explicit reason + tracked todo + human acknowledgment
   - **Upstream** — third-party deprecation that requires a dependency update; opened upstream issue or pinned version with reason
   - **False positive** — explanation of why it does not apply
3. Unacknowledged WARN+ entries BLOCK the gate.

**Exception:** Hooks and cleanup paths where failure is expected may emit WARN entries that are pre-acknowledged in code via a comment marker. Same carve-out as `zero-tolerance.md` Rule 3.

**Why:** Logs that no one reads are worse than no logs at all — they create the illusion of observability while letting the underlying problem fester. Without dedup, a 200-warning test run becomes 200 disposition lines and the agent rationally skips the gate; with dedup, it becomes 5–10 unique entries that are tractable.

### 6. Mask Helper Output Forms

Credential masking helpers MUST fail loudly and uniformly. A helper that bails on a malformed URL but returns a success-shaped string makes log triage believe the credential was masked when in fact it was written elsewhere.

#### 6.1 Mask Failure Sentinels Distinct From Masked Output

A masking helper that fails to parse its input MUST return a sentinel string distinguishable from any successful mask output. Returning the masked-success template (e.g. `"redis://***"`) on failure is BLOCKED.

```python
# DO — distinct sentinel
def mask_url(url: str) -> str:
    try:
        parsed = urlparse(url)
    except Exception:
        return "<unparseable redis url>"  # grep-able failure marker
    if not parsed.scheme or not parsed.hostname:
        return "<unparseable redis url>"
    return f"{parsed.scheme}://***@{parsed.hostname}:{parsed.port or ''}{parsed.path}"

# DO NOT — success-shape on failure
def mask_url(url: str) -> str:
    try:
        parsed = urlparse(url)
    except Exception:
        return "redis://***"  # looks masked; is actually "helper bailed"
```

**Why:** A mask helper that returns the success-shape on failure makes log triage believe the credential was masked when in fact the helper bailed and the credential may have been written to a sibling log line. Distinct sentinels surface the failure to grep.

#### 6.2 Mask Form Uniform Across Helpers

All URL-masking helpers in the codebase MUST emit the canonical `scheme://***@host[:port]/path` form. Variant forms (stripping userinfo entirely, masking only password) are BLOCKED.

```python
# DO — canonical form, grep-able via `***@`
return f"redis://***@cache:6379/0"
return f"postgresql://***@db.internal:5432/kailash"

# DO NOT — userinfo stripped; audit cannot find it
return "redis://cache:6379/0"             # looks like "no credentials" — is actually "stripped"
return f"postgresql://user:***@db/kailash"  # partial mask leaks username
```

**Why:** A grep audit for credential leakage searches for `***@`. Helpers that strip userinfo silently bypass that audit. Uniform output form is what makes the masking layer auditable at all.

### 7. Bulk Operations MUST Log Partial Failures at WARN

Any bulk operation (BulkCreate, BulkUpdate, BulkDelete, BulkUpsert) that catches per-row exceptions MUST emit at least one WARN-level log line when `failed > 0`, including: operation name, total rows, failure count, and a sample error. Exception handlers in bulk ops MUST NOT use `except Exception: continue` or `except Exception: pass` without a WARN log.

```python
# DO — WARN on partial failure
if failed_count > 0:
    logger.warning(
        "bulk_create.partial_failure",
        attempted=total, failed=failed_count,
        first_error=str(errors[0]) if errors else "unknown",
    )

# DO NOT — silent swallow (confirmed absent in kailash-py bulk_create.py:496-498)
except Exception:
    continue  # zero logging, zero signal
```

**Why:** Source audit confirmed: `BulkCreate._handle_batch_error()` has `except Exception: continue` with zero logging; `BulkUpsert` uses `print()` instead of a structured logger. A bulk op returning `failed: 10663` with no WARN line is invisible to alerting pipelines. See 0052-DISCOVERY §2.1 and `guides/deterministic-quality/06-observability-primitives.md` §2.

**BLOCKED responses:**

- "The caller will see the return value, no log needed"
- "We return a failure list, that's enough"
- "We already log at DEBUG"

### 8. Schema-Revealing Field Names MUST Be Logged At DEBUG Or Hashed

Structured log lines that emit schema-level identifiers (model names, column names, field names from classification/masking/validation code paths) MUST be logged at DEBUG level — not WARN or INFO. If an operational WARN is genuinely needed for the condition, emit a counter or a hash, not the raw field name.

```python
# DO — schema names at DEBUG only; operational signal via counter
logger.debug(
    "classification.default_applied",
    extra={"model": model_name, "field": field_name, "default": default},
)
# Operators who need to audit unclassified fields enable DEBUG.
metrics.classification_defaults.inc()  # operational signal without field name

# DO — hash when WARN is required
field_hash = hashlib.sha256(f"{model_name}.{field_name}".encode()).hexdigest()[:8]
logger.warning(
    "classification.default_applied",
    extra={"field_hash": field_hash, "default": default},
)

# DO NOT — schema names at WARN bleed into log aggregators
logger.warning(
    "classification.default_applied",
    extra={"model": "users", "field": "ssn", "default": "public"},
)
# ↑ any log aggregator with broader access than the database now knows
# the schema has `users.ssn`, which is schema-level sensitive info
```

**BLOCKED responses:**

- "The field name isn't the value, it's just the schema"
- "Operators need to see which fields are unclassified"
- "Log aggregator access is the same as database access"
- "DEBUG is off in prod, nobody will see it"

**Why:** Log aggregators (Datadog, Splunk, CloudWatch) are typically accessible to a broader audience than the production database — SREs, on-call engineers, support staff, third-party observability vendors. A WARN log containing `field=ssn` reveals the schema has an `ssn` column to everyone with log read permission, even if the VALUES never leak. Classification metadata is itself schema-level PII-adjacency. DEBUG-level field names stay out of alerting paths and routine dashboards; operators who need to audit unclassified fields enable DEBUG explicitly for the audit window.

Origin: Red team review of PR #430 (2026-04-12) flagged `packages/kailash-dataflow/src/dataflow/classification/policy.py::ClassificationPolicy.classify` emitting field names at WARN. Downgraded to DEBUG in commit 62d64ac7.

### 9. Never Pass Reserved Logger Attribute Names Via Structured-Field Kwargs

Structured loggers reserve attribute names that the logging framework itself owns (the source module, the source filename, the level number, the thread name, etc.). Passing one of those names as a structured field kwarg raises a typed error in some configurations and silently overwrites the framework attribute in others — both fail modes corrupt log triage.

Python `logging.LogRecord` reserves: `msg`, `args`, `module`, `exc_info`, `exc_text`, `stack_info`, `pathname`, `filename`, `name`, `levelname`, `levelno`, `lineno`, `funcName`, `created`, `msecs`, `relativeCreated`, `thread`, `threadName`, `processName`, `process`. Passing any via `extra={}` raises `KeyError: "Attempt to overwrite 'X' in LogRecord"` when mixed with certain logging configurations. Rust `tracing` has the same hazard for fields that collide with span metadata (`target`, `level`, `name`, `module_path`, `file`, `line`).

```python
# DO — domain-prefixed field name
logger.info(
    "estimator.loaded",
    extra={"estimator_module": module_name, "estimator_class": class_name},
)

# DO NOT — collides with LogRecord.module
logger.info(
    "estimator.loaded",
    extra={"module": module_name, "class": class_name},
)
# → KeyError: "Attempt to overwrite 'module' in LogRecord"
# Non-deterministic: may pass when run in isolation, fail when mixed
# with framework-configured logging (kaizen, structlog, etc.)
```

```rust
// DO — domain-prefixed field name (Rust tracing)
tracing::info!(estimator_module = %m, estimator_class = %c, "estimator.loaded");

// DO NOT — collides with span's module_path
tracing::info!(module = %m, "estimator.loaded");
```

**BLOCKED rationalizations:**

- "It worked when I ran the test in isolation"
- "The CI passes, so the collision doesn't matter here"
- "Other modules use `module` as a field name too"
- "The framework warning is non-fatal"

**Why:** Non-deterministic test failures (passes when isolated, fails when mixed with framework-configured logging) are the worst class of test signal — they teach the operator that the test runner is unreliable, not that the code has a real bug. Domain prefixing (`estimator_module`, `query_module`, `agent_module`) is a one-token-cost permanent fix; the alternative is a recurring incident every time a new logging configuration ships.

Origin: kailash-py PR #506 shipped this bug; caught by round-2 redteam; fixed in #509 hotfix (commit 717516f5). Cross-language equivalent applies to Rust `tracing` field collisions and any structured logger that reserves framework attributes.

## MUST NOT

- **No log-and-continue on caught exceptions without action.** If you catch an exception, log it AND either retry, fall back, or re-raise. `logger.error(...); pass` is BLOCKED — same class as `except: pass` in `rules/zero-tolerance.md` Rule 3. **Exception:** hooks and cleanup paths where failure is expected — log at WARN and continue, same carve-out as `zero-tolerance.md` Rule 3.

**Why:** Logging an exception and discarding it produces a paper trail of failures that nothing acts on, creating the worst of both worlds: noisy logs and broken behavior.

- **No log-spam in hot loops.** Per-iteration INFO inside a tight loop floods aggregators and increases bills. Use sample-rate logging or aggregate to one summary line per N items.

**Why:** A 1M-row processing loop emitting one INFO per row produces 1M log lines per run, which both costs money in the aggregator and crowds out the real signal from other components.

- **No unstructured `f"..."` log messages.** Pass fields as keyword arguments to the structured logger, never f-string-interpolate them into the message.

```python
# DO
logger.info("user.created", user_id=uid, plan=plan)

# DO NOT
logger.info(f"User created: {uid} on {plan}")  # cannot filter, cannot aggregate
```

**Why:** F-string-interpolated log messages cannot be queried by field, which defeats the entire purpose of structured logging — operators must regex-match strings instead of filtering on `user_id`.

- **No silent log-level downgrades.** MUST NOT change a WARN/ERROR to INFO to "clean up" CI output. Fix the root cause or document the suppression in the rule itself.

**Why:** Downgrading log levels to silence noise is a Zero-Tolerance Rule 1 violation in disguise — the failure is still happening, the operator just stops seeing it.
