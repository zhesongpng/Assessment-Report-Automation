# Security Rules

ALL code changes in the repository.

## No Hardcoded Secrets

All sensitive data MUST use environment variables.

**Why:** Hardcoded secrets end up in git history, CI logs, and error traces, making them permanently extractable even after deletion.

```
❌ api_key = "sk-..."
❌ password = "admin123"
❌ DATABASE_URL = "postgres://user:pass@..."

✅ api_key = os.environ.get("API_KEY")
✅ password = os.environ["DB_PASSWORD"]
✅ from dotenv import load_dotenv; load_dotenv()
```

## Parameterized Queries

All database queries MUST use parameterized queries or ORM.

**Why:** Without parameterized queries, user input becomes executable SQL, enabling data theft, deletion, or privilege escalation.

```
❌ f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = {user_id}"
❌ "DELETE FROM users WHERE name = '" + name + "'"

✅ "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = %s", (user_id,)
✅ cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?", (user_id,))
✅ User.query.filter_by(id=user_id)  # ORM
```

## Credential Decode Helpers

Connection strings carry credentials in URL-encoded form. Decoding them at a call site with `unquote(parsed.password)` is BLOCKED — every decode site MUST route through a shared helper module so the validation logic lives in exactly one place and drift between sites is impossible.

### 1. Null-Byte Rejection At Every Credential Decode Site (MUST)

Every URL parsing site that extracts `user`/`password` from `urlparse(connection_string)` MUST route through a single shared helper that rejects null bytes after percent-decoding. Hand-rolled `unquote(parsed.password)` at a call site is BLOCKED.

```python
# DO — route through the shared helper
from myapp.utils.url_credentials import decode_userinfo_or_raise

parsed = urlparse(connection_string)
user, password = decode_userinfo_or_raise(parsed)  # raises on \x00 after unquote

# DO NOT — hand-rolled at the call site
from urllib.parse import unquote
parsed = urlparse(connection_string)
user = unquote(parsed.username or "")
password = unquote(parsed.password or "")  # no null-byte check, drifts from other sites
```

**BLOCKED rationalizations:**

- "The existing site already has the check"
- "This is a new dialect, the rule doesn't apply yet"
- "We'll consolidate later"
- "The URL comes from a trusted config file, null bytes can't happen"

**Why:** A crafted `mysql://user:%00bypass@host/db` decodes to `\x00bypass`; the MySQL C client truncates credentials at the first null byte and the driver sends an empty password, succeeding against any row in `mysql.user` with an empty `authentication_string`. Drift between sites that have the check and sites that don't is unauditable without a single helper.

### 2. Pre-Encoder Consolidation (MUST)

Password pre-encoding helpers (`quote_plus` of `#$@?` etc.) MUST live in the same shared helper module as the decode path. Per-adapter copies are BLOCKED.

```python
# DO — single helper module owns both halves of the contract
from myapp.utils.url_credentials import (
    preencode_password_special_chars,
    decode_userinfo_or_raise,
)
url = preencode_password_special_chars(raw_url)
parsed = urlparse(url)
user, password = decode_userinfo_or_raise(parsed)

# DO NOT — inline pre-encode in each adapter
pwd = pwd.replace("@", "%40").replace(":", "%3A").replace("#", "%23")
url = f"postgresql://{user}:{pwd}@{host}/{db}"  # drifts from decode path silently
```

**Why:** Encode and decode are dual halves of one contract; splitting them across modules guarantees one half drifts. Round-trip tests are only meaningful when both ends share the helper.

## Input Validation

All user input MUST be validated before use: type checking, length limits, format validation, whitelist when possible. Applies to API endpoints, CLI inputs, file uploads, form submissions.

**Why:** Unvalidated input is the entry point for injection attacks, buffer overflows, and type confusion across every attack surface.

## Output Encoding

All user-generated content MUST be encoded before display in HTML templates, JSON responses, and log output.

**Why:** Unencoded user content enables cross-site scripting (XSS), allowing attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript in other users' browsers.

```
❌ element.innerHTML = userContent
❌ dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: userContent }}

✅ element.textContent = userContent
✅ DOMPurify.sanitize(userContent)
```

## MUST NOT

- **No eval() on user input**: `eval()`, `exec()`, `subprocess.call(cmd, shell=True)` — BLOCKED

**Why:** `eval()` on user input is arbitrary code execution — the attacker runs whatever they want on the server.

- **No secrets in logs**: MUST NOT log passwords, tokens, or PII

**Why:** Log files are widely accessible (CI, monitoring, support staff) and rarely encrypted, turning every logged secret into a breach.

- **No .env in Git**: .env in .gitignore, use .env.example for templates

**Why:** Once committed, secrets persist in git history even after removal, and are exposed to anyone with repo access.

## Sanitizer Contract — DataFlow Display Hygiene

DataFlow's input sanitizer (`packages/kailash-dataflow/src/dataflow/core/nodes.py::sanitize_sql_input`) is a defense-in-depth display-path safety net, NOT the primary SQLi defense. Parameter binding (`$N` / `%s` / `?`) is the primary defense — see § Parameterized Queries above.

The sanitizer's contract is fixed:

### 1. String Inputs MUST Be Token-Replaced, Not Quote-Escaped

For declared-string fields, the sanitizer MUST replace dangerous SQL keyword sequences with grep-able sentinel tokens (`STATEMENT_BLOCKED`, `DROP_TABLE`, `UNION_SELECT`, etc.). Quote-escaping (`'` → `''`) is BLOCKED.

```python
# DO — token-replace produces grep-able audit trail
"'; DROP TABLE users; --" → "'; STATEMENT_BLOCKED users; -- COMMENT_BLOCKED"

# DO NOT — quote-escape: the payload survives in storage
"'; DROP TABLE users; --" → "''; DROP TABLE users; --"
```

**Why:** Token-replace makes attacker intent grep-able post-incident (`grep STATEMENT_BLOCKED audit.log`). Quote-escape preserves the payload as data, masking that an attack was attempted. The actual injection defense is parameter binding; the sanitizer is the audit trail.

### 2. Type-Confusion MUST Raise, Not Silently Coerce

For declared-string fields receiving `dict` / `list` / `set` / `tuple` values, the sanitizer MUST raise `ValueError("parameter type mismatch: …")`. Silent coercion via `str(value)` is BLOCKED — it lets a nested structure bypass the string-only sanitizer.

```python
# DO — type-confusion is rejected at the validate_inputs gate
if declared_type is str and isinstance(value, (dict, list, set, tuple)):
    raise ValueError(
        f"parameter type mismatch: field '{field_name}' declared as 'str' "
        f"but received '{type(value).__name__}' — type confusion blocked"
    )

# DO NOT — silent str() coercion
value = str(value)  # {"x": "'; DROP TABLE"} becomes "{'x': \"'; DROP TABLE\"}"
# ↑ the dict's contents get sanitized as a string but the original
#   structure already left the validation boundary
```

**Why:** A malicious upstream node that passes `{"injection": "'; DROP TABLE …"}` for a field declared as `str` bypasses every string-only check. Raising at the type-confusion boundary closes the bypass; coercion-to-string converts a structural attack into an unaudited storage event.

### 3. Safe Types Are Returned As-Is

Values of declared-safe types (`int`, `float`, `bool`, `Decimal`, `datetime`, `date`, `time`) MUST pass through unchanged. `dict` and `list` MUST also pass through unchanged when the field's declared type is `dict` or `list` (JSON / array columns). Bug #515 documents this: premature `json.dumps()` on dict/list breaks parameter binding in `AsyncSQLDatabaseNode`.

**BLOCKED rationalizations:**

- "Token-replace is weaker than quote-escape, we should switch"
- "We should silently coerce dict to JSON for safety"
- "Type-confusion is an upstream concern, not the sanitizer's job"
- "The integration tests can catch these"

Origin: GitHub issues #492 (bulk_upsert SQLi via string-escape) + #493 (sanitizer contract drift, 3 pre-existing failing tests). The contract above pins the decision so a future refactor doesn't swing back to quote-escape.

## Multi-Site Kwarg Plumbing

When a security-relevant kwarg (classification policy, tenant scope, clearance context, audit correlation ID) is plumbed through a helper, EVERY call site of that helper MUST be updated in the SAME PR. Updating the "primary" call site and deferring siblings is BLOCKED.

```python
# DO — grep every caller, update every sibling, same PR
# Helper added `policy` + `model_name` kwargs for classification sanitisation.
#
# $ grep -rn 'validate_model(' src/ packages/
# packages/kailash-dataflow/src/dataflow/features/express.py:_validate_if_enabled
# packages/kailash-dataflow/src/dataflow/engine.py::validate_record
#
# Both production call sites get policy+model_name in this PR:
engine.validate_record(instance) -> validate_model(instance, policy=..., model_name=...)
express._validate_if_enabled(...) -> validate_model(instance, policy=..., model_name=...)

# DO NOT — update primary site, skip the sibling
express._validate_if_enabled(...) -> validate_model(instance, policy=..., model_name=...)
engine.validate_record(instance)  -> validate_model(instance)   # bypasses sanitiser
# ↑ The unpatched sibling surface still leaks classified field names / values in
#   error messages; the sanitisation contract is broken on one public entry point.
```

**BLOCKED rationalizations:**

- "The primary call site is the one users hit 99% of the time"
- "The sibling is rarely used; we'll patch it in a follow-up"
- "The helper signature is backwards-compatible, sibling can stay as-is"
- "Test coverage will catch divergence later"
- "The kwarg has a safe default — siblings still get baseline behaviour"

**Why:** A helper that takes a security-relevant kwarg has the kwarg precisely because the unqualified call leaks or misbehaves. Leaving any sibling call site on the unqualified signature ships the exact failure mode the kwarg was introduced to fix; the "safe default" is by definition the insecure default (otherwise the kwarg would not exist). The fix is mechanical — `grep -rn 'helper_name(' .` and patch every hit in the same PR.

Origin: kailash-py PR #522 / PR #529 (2026-04-19) — BP-049 validation sanitiser `validate_model(policy=..., model_name=...)` landed in Express site but `DataFlowEngine.validate_record` was left unqualified; post-release reviewer caught it; fast-patched in dataflow 2.0.12.
